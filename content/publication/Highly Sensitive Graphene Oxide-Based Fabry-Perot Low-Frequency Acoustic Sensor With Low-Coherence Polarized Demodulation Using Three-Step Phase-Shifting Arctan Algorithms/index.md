abstract: Developing low-frequency acoustic senor with high sensitivity is crucial for diverse applications, ranging from seismic monitoring, military operations, to pipeline surveillance. Here, we have proposed a high-sensitivity graphene oxide (GO)-based Fabry-Perot low-frequency sensor, in which a 170 nm thick, large-area and uniformly GO film was prepared by a vacuum filtration method. To enhance the accuracy and stability of the sensor, a low-coherence interference system based on birefringent crystal blocks was designed utilizing a three-step phase-shifting arctangent algorithm. Our sensor exhibited a sensitivity of −93.48 dB re 1 rad/μPa at 6–60 Hz with a fluctuation of 0.6 dB. The minimum detectable pressure of the sensor was measured at 0.37 μPa/Hz 1/2 @20 Hz with a signal to noise ratio of 135.41 dB. Overall, this sensor offers simplicity in preparation, high sensitivity, low detectable sound pressure, making it a significant asset for low-frequency acoustic applications.
